## Introduction
Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The pipeline accepts English text as input and returns the Vietnamese translation.

## Models
I make use of Seq2Seq architecture which Encoder learns the English sentence representation and feed that in Decoder to translate into corresponding Vietnamese sentence.
